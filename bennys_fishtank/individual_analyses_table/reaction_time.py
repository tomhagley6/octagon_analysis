    Checks whether the player chose the high wall or the low wall.
    Gets the time (timepoint in trial) when the chosen wall becomes first visible.
    Gets the time (timepoint in trial) when the player's trajectory first becomes aligned
    with the chosen wall - alignment is based on a threshold of cosine similarity = 0.95.
    Finds the corresponding application times and computes reaction time as difference between them.
    Returns a list of reaction times for every trial in the given trial list and the mean reaction time for the whole trial list.
    Uses inferred choice.
